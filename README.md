# Demographics
This program takes a multifaceted approach at looking at national, state and county demographics
and the associated incomes to this counties. Through this, one is able to take a look at possible income inequality 
based on the demographics of a county. In this stage, this project is run through a user friendly console, but will run
on a website in the near-future. Additionally, the current categories of demographics are just white and non-white, a
functionality that will be improved in the future. In this program, a user-friendly approach towards viewing census data
helps break down data into pieces that the user can understand.
In order to run it, all one should do is just clone the repository and run the program, and the instructions should 
highlight for the user.
